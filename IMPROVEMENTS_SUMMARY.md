# Forest Fire Prediction Model - Comprehensive Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements implemented based on the Grok analysis to address class imbalance, evaluation discrepancies, and under-prediction issues in the ResUNet-A model for forest fire prediction.

## 🔥 Key Problems Addressed

1. **Severe Class Imbalance** (Fire: 0.0001%, No-Fire: 99.9999%)
2. **Evaluation Metric Discrepancies** (Built-in metrics showing high scores vs manual metrics showing zeros)
3. **Under-prediction of Fire** (Model predicting mostly no-fire due to imbalanced training)
4. **Inconsistent Thresholds** (0.5 in metrics vs 0.05 in evaluation)
5. **LULC Categorical Data Handling** (Treated as numeric instead of categorical)

## 🛠️ Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Class Imbalance Handling

**File: `dataset/loader.py`**

- **Increased `fire_focus_ratio`** from 0.7 to 0.9 (90% fire-focused patches)
- **Added Stratified Sampling**: New `fire_patch_ratio=0.2` ensures minimum 20% fire-positive patches per batch
- **Separated Fire/No-Fire Samples** for targeted sampling
- **Enhanced Augmentation**: Added `ShiftScaleRotate` for more variability

**File: `utils/preprocess.py`**

- **Multi-level Fire Detection**:
  - High fire density (>2%)
  - Medium fire density (>0.5%)
  - Any fire activity (>0.0001%)
- **SMOTE-like Augmentation**: Added random offsets to fire-focused patches
- **Smaller Kernel Size**: Reduced from 64 to 32 pixels for more precise fire detection

**File: `train.py`**

- **Updated Focal Loss Parameters**: `alpha=0.75` (stronger fire emphasis), `gamma=2.0`
- **Increased Training Epochs**: From 10 to 20 epochs for better learning
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Changed primary metric from `val_iou_score` to `val_fire_recall`

### 2. LULC One-Hot Encoding

**File: `utils/preprocess.py`**

- **New Function**: `encode_lulc_onehot()` converts LULC band (values 0-3) to 4-channel one-hot encoding
- **Updated `normalize_patch()`**: Input shape (H, W, 9) → Output shape (H, W, 12)
- **Proper Categorical Handling**: LULC band now treated as categorical instead of numeric

**File: `model/resunet_a.py`**

- **Updated Input Shape**: Changed from (256, 256, 9) to (256, 256, 12) to accommodate LULC encoding
- **Increased Dropout**: Default dropout from 0.0 to 0.2 for better regularization

### 3. Consistent Threshold Implementation

**File: `utils/metrics.py`**

- **Updated All Metrics**: `iou_score`, `dice_coef` now use `threshold=0.05` instead of 0.5
- **New Fire-Specific Metrics**: Added `fire_recall` and `fire_precision` with consistent thresholding
- **Configurable Thresholds**: All metrics now accept threshold parameter

**File: `evaluate.py`**

- **Consistent Thresholding**: All evaluation uses same 0.05 threshold
- **Multi-Threshold Analysis**: Tests both 0.05 and 0.1 thresholds for comparison
- **Enhanced Debug Info**: Prediction statistics and histogram analysis

**File: `predict.py`**

- **Updated Custom Objects**: Includes all new metrics with consistent parameters
- **Enhanced Prediction Stats**: Detailed probability distribution analysis

### 4. Enhanced Training Configuration

**File: `train.py`**

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Now tracks `iou_score`, `dice_coef`, `fire_recall`, `fire_precision`
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Added for real-time monitoring
- **Enhanced Callbacks**:
  - Monitor `val_fire_recall` (most important for fire detection)
  - Increased patience to 8 epochs
  - Learning rate reduction factor 0.5
- **Improved Data Splits**: Better temporal splits for validation

### 5. Enhanced Visualization and Monitoring

**File: `train.py`**

- **3x2 Training History Plot**: Includes all metrics including fire-specific ones
- **Fire Metrics Focus Plot**: Dedicated plot for fire recall and precision
- **Enhanced Training Monitor**: GPU memory usage and detailed metric logging

**File: `evaluate.py`**

- **Multi-Threshold Visualization**: Shows results at different thresholds
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Min/max/mean/std of predictions with threshold analysis

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

**New File: `test_fixes.py`**

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Tests all implemented fixes
- **LULC Encoding Test**: Validates one-hot encoding functionality
- **Model Architecture Test**: Confirms 12-channel input works
- **Metrics Consistency Test**: Validates threshold consistency
- **Fire-Focused Coordinates Test**: Ensures enhanced coordinate generation works

**New File: `validate_dataset.py`**

- **Dataset Integrity Check**: Validates stacking completeness
- **Date Mismatch Detection**: Finds missing stack/mask correspondences
- **Fire Statistics Analysis**: Comprehensive fire activity timeline
- **Band Consistency Check**: Validates data quality across files

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### Performance Metrics

- **Fire Recall**: Target >0.5 (previously ~0)
- **Fire Precision**: Balanced with recall for good F1-score
- **Evaluation Consistency**: Built-in and manual metrics should align
- **Threshold Optimization**: 0.05 threshold should improve fire detection

### Training Behavior

- **Reduced Overfitting**: Better regularization with increased dropout
- **Better Convergence**: Enhanced learning rate scheduling and patience
- **Fire Detection**: Model should learn to predict fire areas instead of defaulting to no-fire
- **Stable Metrics**: Validation metrics should show consistent improvement

### Data Quality

- **Stratified Batches**: Each batch contains mix of fire/no-fire patches
- **Enhanced Augmentation**: More diverse training samples
- **Categorical LULC**: Better fuel type representation in model
- **Fire-Focused Sampling**: 90% of patches target fire-prone areas

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Run Tests**: Execute `python test_fixes.py` to validate all fixes
2. **Validate Dataset**: Run `python validate_dataset.py` to check data integrity
3. **Train Model**: Execute `python train.py` with new configuration
4. **Monitor Training**: Use TensorBoard to track fire-specific metrics

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Fire recall > 0.5 after 20 epochs
- [ ] Built-in and manual evaluation metrics align
- [ ] Model predictions show reasonable fire coverage (>0.1%)
- [ ] Training plots show improving fire detection metrics
- [ ] Validation loss decreases consistently

### Scaling Considerations

- **Once successful at 20 epochs**: Scale to 50 epochs
- **Monitor GPU memory**: Current config uses ~437MB, should scale well
- **Learning rate warmup**: Consider if needed for longer training
- **Early stopping**: Adjust patience for longer training runs
